In recent years, their application to drug discovery has accelerated due to their ability to model\nmolecular interactions effectively.\nSection 2: Methodologies\nSeveral GNN architectures have been developed for molecular property prediction:\n\u2022 Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n\u2022 Graph Attention Networks (GATs)\n\u2022 Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)\nEach has unique strengths in capturing local vs. global chemical patterns.\nSection 3: Datasets Used\nPopular benchmark datasets for drug-related GNN research include:\n\u2022 MoleculeNet (e.g., Tox21, HIV)\n\u2022 ZINC dataset\n\u2022 QM9 dataset for quantum property prediction\nSection 4: Performance Metrics\nEvaluation is often done using AUC-ROC, RMSE, or MAE depending on the task. GATs have shown\nstrong performance on classification tasks, while MPNNs perform well on regression tasks.\nSection 5: Conclusion\nGNNs offer a promising future for AI-assisted drug discovery, especially when combined with\ndomain-specific priors and 3D structural data."
